               <p> Some says that I am the funniest Italian guy they ever met, even if I am not italian at all... More seriously I am driven by social interactions within La Tribune association which pronates oratory and politics. I have a team spirit that boosts the confidence of my team. I am passionnate about sport also lke Cycling 🚵‍♂️. My father gave it to me in my early years hence  it's special to me, you have to keep cycling otherwise you are falling down the mountain </p>

            <div class="box-white" id="cinema">
               <h3> Cinema 🎬 </h3>
               <p> I have always been fascinated by other cultures and way of life in general. With cinema, I can aknowledge some skills while learning and entertaining. I believe it will be a huge advantage in my future. From Christopher Nolan, to Villeneuve or even Nicolas Bedos, I love being in front of a huge screen. </p>

            <div class="box-white" id="Sport">
               <h3>Sport is a big chapter of my life</h3>
               <p>To strike my balance, I have to practice sport at least 3 times a week. It keep my calm, relax and alos focused on my classes. It boosts my resilience and dedication to projects. I have been practicing :   </p>
                  <ul>
                     <li> <em> Cycling </em> in a club for 5 years </li>
                     <li> <em> Workout</em> since 3 years now </li>
                     <li> <em> Basketball </em> since I arrived in Lille </li>
                  </ul>
               <p> Workout is great to expand my mind and always going further. It's a mind-blowing experience each team you workout. You surprise yourself</p>

               <h3> Politics 🗣️</h3>
               <p>Ever since I discover this topic, I feel surrounded by it all the time. Across the street, in the class or even at the ultimate Chritsmas family lunch, politics is everywhere. I trualy think everyone should be a bit concerned by this topic as it has to deal with our daily life, and future too. Espically us, youngst, given the uncertainty world we are creating. Everyone should be an <strong>active actor</strong> and to be involded in the democratic life</p>
